Hello, who are you?  
What are you doing here, why are you locked up?  
Why misfortune? I don’t understand.  
I was locked up here too, but not behind bars like you. I am currently undergoing the royal skill test. Can I help you get out of here somehow?  
I am looking for a password that I need to give to the guards to pass this test. Do you know any part of it?  
What exactly?  
And where can I find the recipe for it? I don’t know how to make it.  
Alright, I’ll come back with the soup ready.  
Here you go, your soup.  
And what about our deal?  
What about the remaining parts of the code?  
Thanks, I hope you’re not wrong. If I manage to get out of here, I will convince the king to set you free.
