Where light rarely finds its way,
Beyond a corridor, long and winding like a serpent,
Lies the kingdom of silent voices,
Where centuries endure, bound in parchment.

Not in hiding, nor in a locked chamber,
Not beneath layers of dust and oblivion.
In plain sight, among the keepers of knowledge,
The scroll awaits, ready to be claimed.
