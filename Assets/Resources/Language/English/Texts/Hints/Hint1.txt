Five silent guardians stand so tall,
Each one hides a rubyâ€™s fall.
The table holds a crimson trace,
Yet the secret lies where light finds grace.

Not in wine, nor steel, nor stains so red,
But where the flame rests its head.
Look not at the glow, but the shadow it casts,
There lies the truth, where darkness lasts.
